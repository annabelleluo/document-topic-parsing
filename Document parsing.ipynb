       "'Langsmith can help with testing in several ways:\\n\\n1. Automated Testing: Langsmith can be used to automate the testing of various software components, such as APIs, web applications, and mobile apps. By writing test scripts in Langsmith, you can easily simulate user interactions, input data, and validate the output, making it easier to identify bugs and issues in your software.\\n\\n2. Performance Testing: Langsmith can also be used for performance testing, where you can simulate a large number of concurrent users accessing your system and measure its response time and scalability. This can help you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your software for better performance.\\n\\n3. Integration Testing: Langsmith can help with integration testing by simulating interactions between different software components or services. You can use Langsmith to test how well different parts of your system work together and identify any issues with data exchange or communication.\\n\\n4. Regression Testing: Langsmith can be used for regression testing, where you can re-run test scripts to ensure that new code changes have not introduced any new bugs or issues in your software. By automating regression testing with Langsmith, you can save time and effort compared to manual testing.\\n\\nOverall, Langsmith can streamline the testing process, improve test coverage, and help you deliver high-quality software products to your users.'"

       "[Document(page_content='X is launching two new subscription tiers, including a ‘Premium+’ ad-free plan\\nX, formerly known as Twitter, is introducing two new tiers for its subscription offering in order to bring in additional revenue. The social media giant is adding a new Premium+ tier that costs $16 per month and offers the “largest reply boost” and removes ads from the For You and Following feeds. The tier also comes with revenue-sharing, along with access to other creator tools.\\n\\nThe second tier launching today is called “Basic” and costs $3 per month. The tier doesn’t come with a blue checkmark, but includes basic features like the ability to edit posts and post longer text and videos. It also offers a “small reply boost.”\\nBoth of the new tiers are now available on the web.\\n\\nThe new tiers join the standard X Premium tier, which replaced Twitter Blue. The tier costs $8 per month and gives users a blue checkmark, prioritized ranking in replies, bookmark folders, longer posts, text formatting, themes, sms two-factor authentication, encrypted DMs and more.\\n\\nThe launch of the new tiers comes a few weeks after Bloomberg reported that X was working on new subscription tiers.\\n\\nThe introduction of the new tiers will give X additional ways to grow revenues as it deals with the loss in advertising dollars that it has faced since Elon Musk took the reins of the platform last fall. Musk’s controversial changes have turned away advertisers, as major companies ended up pulling their ads from the social network after their ads were displayed next to hate speech and pro-Nazi content. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the company’s U.S. ad revenue has declined every month since Musk took over, with the latest figures showing a 60% year-over-year decline as of August.\\n\\nSince taking over the company last year, Musk has been looking for ways to generate additional revenue, and has gone so far as charging users in New Zealand and the Philippines $1 per year in order to access the social network.', metadata={'source': 'sample_docu.txt'})]"
